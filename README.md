# PerturbationLib
A library for performing calculations for Particle Physics. 

Contained within are modules for performing representation theory combinations, and generating lagrangians based off symmetries and fields.

There is much to be done, particularly the calculation of amplitudes for processes given a theory, start state, and end state.
